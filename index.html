  <li>Git - a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development.</li>
  <li>Branch - A branch is a parallel version of a repository that can be merged back with the master branch.</li>
  <li>Clone - A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy.</li>
  <li>Commit - A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.</li>
  <li>Fork - A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original.</li>
  <li>Merge - Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.</li>
  <li>Pull - Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them.</li>
  <li>Pull request - Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators.</li>
  <li>Push - Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository, such as a repository hosted on GitHub.</li>
  <li>Repository - A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.</li>
